## Main Goal

The project involves developing a vision system for detecting and reading car license plates.

**Assumptions:**
- The boards in the photos will slant no more than Â± 45 degrees from the horizontal position,
- The longer edge of the plate occupies more than one-third of the width of the photo,
- The angle between the optical axis of the camera and the plane of the plate not more than 45 degrees,
- Ordinary boards are photographed - with black characters on a white background (7 or 8 characters),
- Photos may have different resolution.


## Installation

**Clone** repository and go into folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2acholsk1/car_license_plates_recognizer.git
cd car_license_plates_recognizer
```

After that, you need to setup virtual environment, Makefile commands will help you:
```bash
make setup-venv
```
Remember to activate venv with command: `source bin/activate`.

Then, you can easily build and install package by using:
```bash
make setup
```

## Usage

To **run** program you need use command `Recognize_Plates` to specify folder path from which photos will be taken and give path to save results in `.json` file.
```bash
Recognize_Plates folder/with/photos path/to/save/results
```

## Configuration

There are two configuration files: picture_config.yaml and plate_config.yaml. The first file contains parameters for **sizing the plate** image output and **HSV values** for white and blue color masking. In the second file, the parameters for **character sizing** have been set.


## Results

Example output of recognized text from license plates in `.json` file:
